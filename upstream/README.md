# Activ'it

This tool is used to generate pedagogical html5 resources.
Thanks to it, you can generate three kinds of resources :
- first ones : Images actives. It is simple images on which we can make a focus on some details by zooming and adding descriptions.
- second ones : games using what we call the "1 click with scoring".
- third ones : games using what we call the "drag and drop with scoring" and "drag and drop without scoring"
